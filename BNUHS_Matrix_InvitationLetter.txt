Join the Open-Matrix-Standard (OMS) — Building a Digital Soul for Every School
To all students and developers passionate about AI, coding, and the future of education:

A school is more than just a collection of classrooms; it is a "Matrix" of dynamic knowledge and emerging logic.

Born from the digital experiments at Beijing Normal University Affiliated High School (BNUHS), we are proud to announce the Open-Matrix-Standard (OMS). This is not just a toolkit—it is a next-generation Agent interaction standard designed with Neural Perception and Knowledge Synthesis.

We are looking for:

Knowledge Capsule Architects: Transform your expertise (Physics, History, Art, etc.) into AI-readable "Knowledge Capsules."

Prompt Engineers: Refine the 5-layer interaction logic of OMS to make AI Agents more intuitive and empathetic.

Campus Evangelists: Adapt OMS to your own school, grounding it with local data and Google Maps to create your own digital twin.

Why contribute to OMS? We are leading the paradigm shift from "Skill-based Logic" to "Knowledge Logic." Every Prompt you contribute is not just a line of code—it is a neuron in the digital brain of a future-ready campus.

Take Action Now: Fork our repository on GitHub and submit your first Pull Request. Let’s reshape the campus experience in the digital realm together.
